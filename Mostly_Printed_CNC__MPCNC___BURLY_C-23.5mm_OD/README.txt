The only special tools needed are a hacksaw, and a drill to for 4 holes.   
   
This can be easily expanded to almost any length, width, and depth depending on rigidity required. Shorter lengths = more rigid.  This is built using hardware store emt conduit (In the US it is sold as 3/4" (ID)), or as an upgrade you can use stainless steel tubing.

 Most woods and plastics should be no problem, https://youtu.be/Ub2qablc-GE. I milled Aluminum with a footprint of 23.5in x 32in x 4in.  Aluminum works well https://youtu.be/BRFeZESDo4k Yes, even some Steel https://youtu.be/1CX3qui0-Yo.

You can switch the spindle out with a drag knife, laser, Extruder, ect, making it a great prototyping multi-tool. By adding length and depth It could easily be used to shape large easily milled things like wood, foam, or plastics. Keep it small for metals.
